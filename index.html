		<h1> Alt-right memes</h1>
			<p>Memes are cultural units of meaning (<i>image, text or audio fragments</i>) that develop and spread virally by copying or combining with other units. Memes have become a <u>central means of online communication</u> and can influence how we see the world and thereby shape our views. Internet memes consist of images, captions or GIFs. <u>Anyone can create, edit and share a meme</u>. Limor Shifman argues that funny or ironic memes in particular have the power to foster political and social participation.</p>
			
		<blockquote>"There was alt-right and borderline Holocaust-denial stuff, memes, showing up"</blockquote>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Instagram is a fertile ground for extremist propaganda, experts told Insider.</li>
			<li>Neo-Nazi groups are using the social media platform to recruit teenagers <sub>the experts said</sub></li>
			<li>Parents are now being advised to spot far-right messaging to protect their kids.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Wojak</h2>
			<img src="wojak.png" width="300" height="300" border=2>
			<p>The original iteration of the <b>Wojak</b> meme expressed emotions such as melancholy, regret or loneliness. It has gradually been adapted and advanced by far-right meme culture to portray liberals with blank expressions. The aim here is to show that <i>“normies”</i> do not question the information that comes from mainstream press and politics. </p>

		<h2>Doge</h2>
			<img src="doge.png" width="400" height="400">
			<p>The <b>Doge </b>meme is one of the most famous internet memes, which has been adapted in various ways to tease a kind of outdated humour and style of individuals and politicians. In far-right circles, it has often been combined with Nazi memorabilia to trivialise violence <s><sup>by the SS and Wehrmacht</sup></s>.</p>

		<h2>Pepe the frog</h2>
			<img src="pepe.jpeg" width="350" height="350">
			<p>The <b>Pepe the Frog</b> meme has been appropriated by far-right online activists. It symbolises <i>“a kind of superior nonchalance toward others, helping to normalize hostile attitudes toward minorities and political opponents”</i> as well as <i>“a kind of anti-elite arrogance and condescension”</i>. It has become the icon of the alt-right.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Some people do think that there's no reason for normal people to be familiar with these memes. </li>
			<li>Some think that the role these subcultures played or claim to have played in the election necessitates taking them seriously. </li>
			<li>Some people objected to giving ownership of certain concepts to the alt-right, including "feels guy." </li>
			<li>Some people argue Discord is primarily used as a communication tool in online gaming, and is not primarily alt-right. </li>
			<li>If you can't believe this is language used in real life by real people, you're not alone.</li>

					<td>#AnimeRight</td>
					<td>Alt-righters who use anime avatars on Twitter and other online spaces. The kinds of people who hang out in spaces like 4chan or 8chan tend to also be big anime fans. Like many of the items on this list, this idea occupies a constantly moving point on the irony spectrum. </td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Snowflake</td>
					<td>Short for "special snowflake," an insult to SJWs. The joke is that that they're fragile and coddled millennials who were raised on participation trophies and being told they were special.</td>
